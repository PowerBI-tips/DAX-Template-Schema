# DAX-Template-Schema
This is a repo to collaborate and work on a common schema that can be used to define a DAX Template.

# Core Principals
DAX is written in code. Thus, code can be parameterized and built in a re-usable way. This project aims to address the common problem of writing DAX over and over again.  

By dissecting the DAX language and looking for common patterns we can build tooling around creating DAX statements that are reusable across any data model. 

# Tooling
The schema used in this repo support the fields generated by the free tool [DAX.PowerBI.tips](https://dax.powerbi.tips/). This project has been created to help business users create templates of DAX. Then the website generates a JSON file that can be consumed by external tools such as [DAX Generator from PowerBI Side tools](https://thebipower.fr/index.php/power-bi-sidetools/)
