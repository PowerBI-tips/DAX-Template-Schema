# DAX-Template-Schema
This is a repo to collaborate and work on a common schema that can be used to define a DAX Template.



# Tooling
The schema used in this repo support the fields generated by the free tool [DAX.PowerBI.tips](https://dax.powerbi.tips/). This project has been created to help business users create templates of DAX. Then the website generates a JSON file that can be consumed by external tools such as [DAX Generator from PowerBI Side tools](https://thebipower.fr/index.php/power-bi-sidetools/)

For a full presentation of this concept watch the following presentation from PowerBI.tips on [The Worlds Fastest DAX](https://youtu.be/XEQpOswpkUI?t=359).
